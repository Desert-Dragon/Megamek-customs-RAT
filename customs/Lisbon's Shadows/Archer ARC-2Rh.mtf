overview: First developed for the SLDF, the Archer would become a mainstay of many heavy support lances. Tough and reliable, the Archer is commonly taken as a Command 'Mech by many officers, where it can contribute to battle at range while keeping their MechWarrior away from the thickest combat.
capabilities: Twin LRM-20 racks set this 'Mech firmly in the fire-support role. Recognition of the missile's innaccuracy at short range mandated the inclusion of four medium lasers, while powerful hand actuators make the Archer a dangerous brawler during physical engagements. As such an archtypal fire-support 'Mech, the Archer pairs well with dedicated spotters for its massive missile barrages. When combined with well-trained squads of Infantry, VTOLs, or even other 'Mechs, Archers can easily disable their chosen targets without ever being in direct sight of them.
deployment: With more than a hundred thousand built prior to the Succession Wars, the Archer can be found within the entire Sphere and Periphery. Many factories still produce the Archer, though a few have developed their own variants of the venerable design. The base variant is still regarded as highly performant, however, and certain manufacturers such as Earthwerks Incorporated in the Free Worlds League continue to solely produce the ARC-2R. This particular variant, the "2Rh", is a more destilled support mech, sacrificing a medium laser and a bit of armor, for more LRM ammo and better heat management, allowing it to fire a full 40 missile salvo every 10 seconds.
